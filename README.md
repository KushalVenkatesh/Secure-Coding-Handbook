# Secure Coding Handbook

Welcome to the **Secure Coding Handbook!** Here, you will find everything that I have found on secure coding: best practices, analyzing, and, of course, patching **code-related** vulnerabilities. All of the enumerated attacks and defensive techniques are strictly related to web applications. (for now :) )

#### Spotted a bug?

Making mistakes is human nature, fortunately. Please note that I am by no means an expert and should you find something that is totally erroneous or deviated from the subject, please [create an issue here](https://github.com/joswha/Secure-Coding-Handbook/issues).&#x20;

#### Want to contribute?

Sure thing! Message me on Twitter [**@VladToie**](https://twitter.com/VladToie), or simply write a pull request in the [**Secure-Coding-Handbook**](https://github.com/joswha/Secure-Coding-Handbook) repository.

You can also buy me a **Pizza so I wouldn't have to cook it myself, and write more guides in that time =D**&#x20;
